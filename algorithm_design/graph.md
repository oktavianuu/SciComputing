#### What is Graph?
Graphs are data structures representing relations between pairs of elements. These elements, called nodes, can be real-life objects, entities, points in space or others. The connections between the nodes are called the edges.

For example, a graph can be used to represent two points in the space, A and B, connected by a path. A graph like this will be made of two nodes connected by an edge.
