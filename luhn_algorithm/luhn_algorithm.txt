The Luhn algorithm is as follows:

1. From the right to left, double the value of every second digit; if the product is greater than 9, sum the digits of the products.
2. Take the sum of all the digits.
3. If the sum of all the digits is a multiple of 10, then the number is valid; else it is not valid.
