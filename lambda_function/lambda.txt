INTRO:
Lambda functions give us a concise way to write small, throwaway functions in our code.

In this project, we'll explore the power of Lambda Functions by creating an expense tracker. Our resulting app will demonstrate how we can use Lambda Functions 
for efficient, streamlined operations.

Lambda functions are brief, anonymous functions in Python, ideal for simple, one-time tasks. They are defined by the lambda keyword, and they use the following syntax:

lambda x: expr

In the example above, x is a parameter to be used in the expression expr.

Lambda functions can be valuably combined with the map() function, which executes a specified function for each element in a collection of objects, such as a list:
map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
the function above will result:
[2, 4, 6]
